    Alice Roosevelt was the eldest daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt and his only child with his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee.
  </br></br>
With her mother's beauty, and all of her father's wit, cunning, and confidence, she would grow into a force to be reckoned with, fit to rival her famous father.
  
Here are some of her highlights.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>While her father was still Governor of New York, he and his second wife Edith proposed sending Alice to a strict, conservative girls school in Manhattan in an effort to calm her wild behavior. Alice refused to go, writing to her father "If you send me I will humiliate you. I will do something that will shame you. I tell you I will."</li>
  </br>
  <li>When President William McKinley was assassinated and her father became President, Alice is said to have greeted the news with "sheer rapture." She became an instant celebrity and fashion icon upon her family's move to Washington, with the press dubbing her "Princess Alice." Her favorite color, a pale blue, was re-named "Alice blue," there were songs written about her, and the Roosevelts had to hire a secretary just to handle her fan mail.</li>
<br>
  <li>Alice partied constantly, and the press ate it up, occasionally running the stories of her shenanigans before the real news in that day's paper. The <em>New York Herald</em> once kept a count of Alice's social life over a 15-month period - during that time Alice attended 407 dinners, 350 balls, 300 parties, 680 teas, and 1,706 social calls. Occasionally Alice would even go so far as to call in tips about her own whereabouts, just to collect the cash reward for the information.</li>
</br>
<li>During a time when Edwardian notions of traditional womenhood still held strong, Alice drank, wore pants, smoked in public (often on the White House roof), played poker, placed bets with bookies, drover her own car around the streets of Washington with a young man in tow, kept mini whiskey bottles in her opera gloves, and partied all night long.</li>
</br>
  <li>She kept a pet snake named Emily Spinach - Emily after her spinster aunt and Spinach for its green color. She liked to carry Emily Spinach around in her purse, alongside a dagger and a copy of the Constitution.</li>
</br>
<li>In 1905, partially in an attempt to get her out of Washington and out of his hair, her father Theodore tapped her to lead a diplimatic mission to Japan, Hawaii, China, the Philippines, and Korea, along with his then Secretary of War, William Howard Taft. Alice behaved herself in front of the local dignitaries, but along the way she found ways to amuse herself. She learned to hula in Hawaii, set off fireworks from the back of their train on the 4th of July, jumped fully clothed into the swimming pool of their cruise ship, and carried on an affair with Congressman Nicholas Longworth, whom she would later marry.</li>
</br>
<li>During her White House wedding reception, she didn't like the knife she was given to the cut the cake, so she borrowed a sword from her father's military aide and used that instead. </li></br>
<li>After her father's time in office Alice was twice banned from visiting the White House by the curent administration. Once for burying a voodoo doll of the incoming First Lady, Helen Taft, somewhere on the White House grounds, and again for constantly badmouthing Woodrow Wilson in public.</li></br>
  <li>She didn't care much for her famous Roosevelt cousins, Franklin and Eleanor. The political opposites of her father, Alice once complained "When I think of Frank and Eleanor in the White House I could grind my teeth to powder and blow them out my nose." Eleanor, for her part, thought that Alice lived a life full of "dreariness and waste" that was “one long pursuit of pleasure and excitement and rather little real happiness.”</li>
</br>
  <li>She approved of the womens movement of the 1960's, calling Gloria Steinem "one of my heroes." When asked her opinion of the era's accompanying sexual revolution, she admitted that she'd always lived by the motto of "Fill what’s empty, empty what’s full, and scratch where it itches."</li></br>
  <li>As the years went on she began to be known as "The Other Washington Monument," becoming friends with the Kennedys, Nixons, and the Johnsons.</li>
</br> 
  <li>She famously kept a pillow in her DuPont Circle mansion embroidered with the motto "If you can't say something nice about someone, sit right here by me."</li>
  </br>

  <li>After years of health problems, she died on February 20, 1980, at the age of 96. Upon her death, then President Jimmy Carter said of her, “She had style, she had grace, and she had a sense of humor that kept generations of political newcomers to Washington wondering which was worse—to be skewered by her wit or to be ignored by her.” </li>
</ul>
